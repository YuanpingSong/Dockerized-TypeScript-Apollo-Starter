# Dockerized TypeScript Apollo Starter

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a convenient starting point for implementing a GraphQL microservices backend using a combination of Docker, TypeScript and Apollo Server. I will try my best to maintain and improve this repo, but any contributions and recommendations will be most welcome.
